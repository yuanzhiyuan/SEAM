SEAM: a Spatial single nuclEar metAboloMics method for dissecting tissue microenvironment
===========================================================================

![Alt text](SEAM/data/img/SEAM_whole.png?raw=true "SEAM overview")

``SEAM`` is a scalable platform combining high resolution imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) and a series of computational algorithms, that can display multiscale/multicolor tissue tomography together with identification and clustering of single nuclei by their in situ metabolic fingerprints. 


This repo provides notebooks for [tutorial and demonstration](SEAM/ipynbs/demostration/), [figure regeneration](SEAM/ipynbs/figure_regeneration/), [method comparison](SEAM/ipynbs/comparison/), and [spatial transcriptome analysis](SEAM/ipynbs/transcriptome/).

Note that the revised version of SEAM can be found in another repo "SEAM_revision". We maintain this original version of SEAM to better assess the change for reviewers.
